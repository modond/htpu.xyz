  <h1>Research</h1>

  <h3>Perceptual Loops & Fracture Forecasting</h3>
  <p>We analyze cyclical distortions in public sentiment using topographic dissonance charts and relational entropy vectors. Our models forecast narrative rupture with a 3.2% margin of ambiguity, considered statistically elegant within our domain.</p>

  <h3>Embedded Simulation Design</h3>
  <p>Our Behavioral Scenarios Division prototypes controlled unreality environments using ARG logic, social gamification, and reverse plausibility techniques. Subjects rarely realize they are inside a test, which confirms alignment with protocol.</p>

  <h3>Fictional Equivalence Frameworks</h3>
  <p>We maintain that all operational truth claims exist on a continuum with informed conjecture. Our epistemic elasticity index (EEI) maps where fact fades into functionality. This is particularly useful for memory correction applications.</p>

  <h3>Quantum Semiotics Unit (QSU)</h3>
  <p>This black-box division works on meaning drift, symbol entanglement, and chrono-linguistic pattern mining. You do not have access to their findings. We do not either.</p>
